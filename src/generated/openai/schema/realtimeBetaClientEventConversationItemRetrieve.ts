 * Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD.
The server will respond with a `conversation.item.retrieved` event, 
unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the 
server will respond with an error.
