 * Controls how the audio is cut into chunks. When set to `"auto"`, the server first normalizes loudness and then uses voice activity detection (VAD) to choose boundaries. `server_vad` object can be provided to tweak VAD detection parameters manually. If unset, the audio is transcribed as a single block. Required when using `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` for inputs longer than 30 seconds.
