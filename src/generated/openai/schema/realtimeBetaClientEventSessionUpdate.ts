/**
 * Send this event to update the session’s default configuration.
The client may send this event at any time to update any field,
except for `voice`. However, note that once a session has been
initialized with a particular `model`, it can’t be changed to
another model using `session.update`.

When the server receives a `session.update`, it will respond
with a `session.updated` event showing the full, effective configuration.
Only the fields that are present are updated. To clear a field like
`instructions`, pass an empty string.
