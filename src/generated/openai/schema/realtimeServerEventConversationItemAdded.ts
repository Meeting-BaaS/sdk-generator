/**
 * Sent by the server when an Item is added to the default Conversation. This can happen in several cases:
- When the client sends a `conversation.item.create` event.
- When the input audio buffer is committed. In this case the item will be a user message containing the audio from the buffer.
- When the model is generating a Response. In this case the `conversation.item.added` event will be sent when the model starts generating a specific Item, and thus it will not yet have any content (and `status` will be `in_progress`).

The event will include the full content of the Item (except when model is generating a Response) except for audio data, which can be retrieved separately with a `conversation.item.retrieve` event if necessary.
