/**
 * An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You
can specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter.

We support the following categories of tools:
- **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the
  model's capabilities, like [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search)
  or [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about
  [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools).
- **MCP Tools**: Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers
  or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about
  [MCP Tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,
  enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments
  and outputs. Learn more about
  [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). You can also use
  custom tools to call your own code.
