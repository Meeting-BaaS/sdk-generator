  /** The url to which a notification message will be sent upon
completion of the job. The job `id` and `status` are added
as query parameters, and any combination of the job inputs
and outputs can be included by listing them in `contents`.

If `contents` is empty, the body of the request will be
empty.

If only one item is listed, it will be sent as the body of
the request with `Content-Type` set to an appropriate value
such as `application/octet-stream` or `application/json`.

If multiple items are listed they will be sent as named file
attachments using the multipart content type.

If `contents` is not specified, the `transcript` item will
be sent as a file attachment named `data_file`, for
backwards compatibility.

If the job was rejected or failed during processing, that
will be indicated by the status, and any output items that
are not available as a result will be omitted. The body
formatting rules will still be followed as if all items were
available.

The user-agent header is set to `Speechmatics-API/2.0`, or
`Speechmatics API V2` in older API versions.
