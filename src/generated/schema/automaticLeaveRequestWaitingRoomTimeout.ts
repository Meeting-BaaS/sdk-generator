 * The timeout in seconds for the bot to wait in the waiting room before leaving the meeting, defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes). Minimum: 120 seconds (2 minutes). Maximum: 1800 seconds (30 minutes). Note: Google Meet also has it's own waiting room timeout (about ~10 minutes). Setting a higher value for such meetings would have no effect because Google Meet will deny entry to the bot after its own timeout.
