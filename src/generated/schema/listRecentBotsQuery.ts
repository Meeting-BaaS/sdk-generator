Example: "Sales" would match "Sales Meeting", "Quarterly Sales", etc. */

Limits results to bots created at or after the specified timestamp. Used for time-based filtering to find recent additions.

Limits results to bots created at or before the specified timestamp. Used for time-based filtering to exclude recent additions.

This parameter performs in-memory filtering on the `extra` JSON field, similar to a SQL WHERE clause. It reduces the result set to only include bots that match all specified conditions.

Format specifications: - Single condition: "field:value" - Multiple conditions: "field1:value1,field2:value2"

Examples: - "customer_id:12345" - Only bots with this customer ID - "status:active,project:sales" - Only active bots from sales projects

Notes: - All conditions must match for a bot to be included - Values are matched exactly (case-sensitive) - Bots without the specified field are excluded */

Example: "zoom.us" would match all Zoom meetings */

This parameter performs in-memory sorting on the `extra` JSON field, similar to a SQL ORDER BY clause. It changes the order of results but not which results are included.

Format specifications: - Default (ascending): "field" - Explicit direction: "field:asc" or "field:desc"

Examples: - "customer_id" - Sort by customer_id (ascending) - "priority:desc" - Sort by priority (descending)

Notes: - Applied after all filtering - String comparison is used for sorting - Bots with the field come before bots without it - Can be combined with filter_by_extra */

Performs a case-insensitive partial match on the speakers in the meeting. Useful for finding meetings that included a specific person.

Example: "John" would match meetings with speakers like "John Smith" or "John Doe" */
