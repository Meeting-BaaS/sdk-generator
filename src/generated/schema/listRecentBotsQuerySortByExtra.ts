/**
 * Sort the results by a field in the extra JSON payload.

This parameter performs in-memory sorting on the `extra` JSON field, similar to a SQL ORDER BY clause. It changes the order of results but not which results are included.

Format specifications: - Default (ascending): "field" - Explicit direction: "field:asc" or "field:desc"

Examples: - "customer_id" - Sort by customer_id (ascending) - "priority:desc" - Sort by priority (descending)

Notes: - Applied after all filtering - String comparison is used for sorting - Bots with the field come before bots without it - Can be combined with filter_by_extra
