/**
 * Filter bots by matching values in the extra JSON payload.

This parameter performs in-memory filtering on the `extra` JSON field, similar to a SQL WHERE clause. It reduces the result set to only include bots that match all specified conditions.

Format specifications: - Single condition: "field:value" - Multiple conditions: "field1:value1,field2:value2"

Examples: - "customer_id:12345" - Only bots with this customer ID - "status:active,project:sales" - Only active bots from sales projects

Notes: - All conditions must match for a bot to be included - Values are matched exactly (case-sensitive) - Bots without the specified field are excluded
