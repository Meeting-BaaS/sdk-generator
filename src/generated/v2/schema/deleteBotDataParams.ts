 * Whether to delete transcription data from the transcription provider.

If `true` (default), the transcription data will be deleted from the transcription provider's servers in addition to deleting artifacts from S3. This ensures complete data deletion.

If `false`, only S3 artifacts will be deleted, and transcription data will remain on the transcription provider's servers.

Note: If the bot was created with a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) transcription API key, the deletion will use that key to authenticate with the transcription provider.

Default: `true`
