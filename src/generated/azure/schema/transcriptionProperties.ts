When a destination container is used in combination with a `timeToLive`, the metadata of a
transcription will be deleted normally, but the data stored in the destination container, including
transcription results, will remain untouched, because no delete permissions are required for this
container.<br />
To support automatic cleanup, either configure blob lifetimes on the container, or use "Bring your own Storage (BYOS)"
instead of `destinationContainerUrl`, where blobs can be cleaned up. */
